# 🧠 AI Blog Generation Platform

A comprehensive and scalable **AI-powered blog generation platform** built with a modern web architecture. This project allows users to schedule and automatically generate blog posts using **OpenAI's GPT model**, combining the power of **Django** on the backend and **Next.js** on the frontend. Real-time updates, scheduled tasks, and an intuitive user interface make it a production-ready solution for automated content creation.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### 🔧 Backend (Django)

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the core of the backend, handle routing, models, and authentication.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, enabling the frontend to interact with backend data seamlessly.
- **SimpleJWT**: Implements secure user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Celery**: Handles background tasks asynchronously, especially for scheduling AI-generated blogs.
- **Celery Beat**: Adds periodic task scheduling capabilities, used to check and generate blogs at scheduled times.
- **Redis**: Acts as the message broker for Celery and can be used for caching and speeding up performance.
- **Django Channels**: Enables asynchronous support in Django, powering WebSockets for real-time blog updates.
- **django-celery-beat**: Integrated with the Django admin panel for managing periodic tasks via the UI.
- **OpenAI Python SDK**: Connects to the GPT model for AI-generated blog content.

### 🌐 Frontend (Next.js)

- **Next.js**: Combines server-side rendering with the power of React to create a fast, SEO-friendly UI.
- **React**: Component-based JavaScript library for building responsive and interactive UIs.
- **Axios**: Used to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend APIs.
- **Material UI (MUI)**: Delivers pre-built, accessible components that follow Google's Material Design.
- **Tailwind CSS (optional)**: Can be used for utility-first styling and rapid UI development.
- **next/navigation**: Enables dynamic routing and client-side transitions in Next.js.

### ⚙️ Infrastructure & Workflow

- **Celery Worker**: Continuously runs in the background, listening for tasks such as blog generation and executing them outside the request-response cycle.
- **Redis Server**: Acts as a fast, in-memory broker that queues tasks for Celery.
- **Docker (optional)**: For containerizing and deploying the app seamlessly across environments.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Backend SQL database used for storing user data, blog metadata, and scheduling info.

## 💡 Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- Register and log in users securely using **JWT** tokens.
- Protect sensitive endpoints and WebSocket connections using JWT.

### ✍️ AI-Powered Blog Creation

- Generate long-form blog articles using **OpenAI's GPT API**.
- Users can select a **category** and **length**, or write a **custom prompt**.
- AI-generated blogs are automatically saved and associated with the user.

### ⏰ Blog Scheduling

- Schedule blog posts for future generation using **Celery Beat**.
- Automatically triggers blog creation at the specified time.
- Scheduled tasks are managed in the admin dashboard or via API.

### 📡 Real-Time Notifications (WebSocket)

- Get notified in real-time when your blog is generated.
- Uses **Django Channels** and **WebSocket endpoints** to broadcast messages.

### 📊 Admin Dashboard

- Built-in **Django Admin** to manage users, scheduled stories, and AI logs.
- Control and monitor task executions using **django-celery-beat** UI.

### 🛠 Extensible API

- RESTful API endpoints for:
  - User registration and login
  - Scheduling blog posts
  - Fetching user-generated blogs
  - WebSocket authentication
- Can be extended to integrate with other AI providers or data sources.
